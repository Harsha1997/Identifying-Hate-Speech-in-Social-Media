We need the following additional libraries to the ones discussed in the class: 

1) Keras : conda install -c conda-forge keras

2) nltk : conda install -c anaconda nltk

3) wordcloud : conda install -c conda-forge wordcloud 

4) imbalanced-learn: conda install -c conda-forge imbalanced-learn

We have used used the glove embeddings for training LSTM, whose gensim is present under the data folder. (No installs need to be done)
